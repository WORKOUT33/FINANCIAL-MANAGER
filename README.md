4. Build the TypeScript Code
If the project uses TypeScript, it needs to be compiled into JavaScript before running.
1.	Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
npx tsc
This will generate JavaScript files in the output directory specified in the tsconfig.json file (commonly dist or build).

5. Run the Application
Depending on how the project is configured, there are multiple ways to run it:
Using a Development Server
1.	Check if a development server is set up (e.g., via vite, webpack, or similar). Look in the package.json file for scripts like start or dev.
2.	Run the server:
npm start
or
npm run dev
This will start a local development server, and you can access the application in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.
Opening the HTML File Directly
If the project doesn't require a development server:
1.	Locate the index.html file in the project directory (commonly in the public or dist folder).
2.	Open the file directly in your browser by dragging and dropping it into the browser window.

6. Building for Production (Optional)
If you want to create a production build:
1.	Run the build command:
npm run build
2.	The optimized files will be available in the output folder (commonly dist or build). Host these files on any web server.
